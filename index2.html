     <!-- const declaration declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the assignment operator, but if a constant is an object, its properties can be added, updated, or removed.(EX: Pizza can't be false because its already true) -->
     
     <!-- //*NOTE: When declaring wtih let you get an uncaught syntax error saying "Identifier 'pizza' has already been decleared and line 11" -->
